# Quotations Generator
Builing quotations generator in Vanilla JavaScript

**New Update** Added a react version of Quote generator

## About 

### Step 1: Random quotes

* The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JavaScript call

* Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments (it's up to you to create these sentence fragments: beginning, middle, and end)

* The quotes should be relatively coherent 

### Step 2: More customized quotes

* Select the number of quotes generated (between 1 and 5)

* Choose between 2 types of quote generators (accordingly, you'll need two different sets of sentences)

* Once the quotes are generated, have the program generate new quotes or quit the program
